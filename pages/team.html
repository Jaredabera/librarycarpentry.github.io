<h2>Library Carpentry Advisory Group</h2>

<p>The Advisory Group acts as a critical friend to Carpentries governance and staff and advises on ways to foster greater participation in the Library Carpentry community. The Group meets on a bi-monthly basis to discuss, plan, and pursue strategies for involving new and current members in Library Carpentry. It is not a governance group and does not make decisions for the Library Carpentry community.</p>

<h4>2019-2020 Goals:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Inform the Library Carpentry community about the Advisory Group and that it is a resource for the community.</li>
<li>Check-in with at least 5-10 Library Carpentry community members, see what they are up to following the workshops they hosted, helped with, and/or instructed.</li>
<li>Draft letter of interest to explore pool of funding to empower libraries to start local Library Carpentry activities.</li>
</ul>
