<h2>Library Carpentry Advisory Group</h2>

<p>The Advisory Group acts as a critical friend to Carpentries governance and staff and advises on ways to foster greater participation in the Library Carpentry community. The Group meets asynchronously online via Slack and occasionally via Zoom to discuss, plan, and pursue strategies for involving new and current members in Library Carpentry. Members of the Group rotate in and out on a yearly and bi-yearly basis. It is not a governance group and does not make decisions for the Library Carpentry community. <em>Note: Formerly known as the <a href="https://librarycarpentry.org/team/">Library Carpentry Governance Group</a>.</em></p>

<h4>Current 2019-2020 Goals:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Inform the Library Carpentry community about the Advisory Group and that it is a resource for the community.</li>
<li>Check-in with at least 5-10 Library Carpentry community members, see what they are up to following the workshops they hosted, helped with, and/or instructed.</li>
<li>Draft letter of interest to explore pool of funding to empower libraries to start local Library Carpentry activities.</li>
<li> Map Library Carpentry/Carpentries material to resume/CV/job descriptions/competencies.</li>
<li>Discuss/pilot Library Carpentry/Carpentries ideas in library & information science programs.</li>
<li>Describe other ways of teaching the material that don't require hosting an entire workshop.</li>
<li>Survey to Library Carpentry workshop attendees, 6 months after, assess impact, gather stories.</li> 
</ul>
