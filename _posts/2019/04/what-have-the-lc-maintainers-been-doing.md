In January 2019, the Library Carpentry Maintainers met online to discuss a variety of topics from communication channels to giving credit. The discussions helped with tackling big questions and understanding how we wanted to work as Maintainers.  

See [News from the Library Carpentry Maintainer Community and Curriculum Advisory Committee](https://librarycarpentry.org/blog/2019/02/news-from-lc-maintainers/)

What have the Maintainers been up to since then? This blog post will catch you up on what all the lesson Maintainer teams have been doing since January. The following are brief reports from the groups:  

*Introduction to Data*  
_Carmi Cronje, Paul Pival, Shari Laster*, Anton Angelo, James Baker_  
The group met for the first time in February. They discussed how they will work together and agreed to reach out to instructors that have previously taught _Introduction to Data_ to gather their feedback and determine their next steps towards improving the lesson. Their next meeting is in May.  

*The UNIX Shell*  
_Danielle Kane*, Nilani Ganeshwaran, John Wright, Anna Oates, Belinda Weaver, Tim Dennis_  
They will meet soon in April/May with members of the group already expressing interest in adding more library examples to the lesson.  

*OpenRefine*  
_Owen Stephens, Juliane Schneider, Paul Pival, Kristin Lee, Erin Carrillo*, Carmi Cronje_  
The group has been working on updating information about the OpenRefine versions used in the lesson and Paul Pival volunteered to address outdated issues.  

*Introduction to Git*  
_Chris Erdmann, Thea Atwood, Drew Heles*, Katrin Leinweber, Eva Seidlmayer, Belinda Weaver, Jez Cope_  
The Maintainers for this lesson met in March and decided to reach out to instructors that have taught the lesson for their feedback. Eva Seidlmayer developed concept maps to help guide the group’s discussions. Some of the core concepts for the lesson that the group highlighted in discussions include file sharing, versioning, collaboration with researchers, and publishing websites. There are still some remaining questions for the Maintainers to consider, for instance, whether it is best to teach git on the command line or via GitHub/GitLab and how the lesson compliments other available lessons (like Software Carpentry’s Git lesson).  

*Tidy Data*  
_Tim Dennis, Thea Atwood, Sherry Lake*, Erika Mias, Jez Cope_  
The Maintainers will meet in the next 2-3 months.  

*SQL*  
_Kristin Lee, Chris Erdmann, Jordan Pedersen*, Elaine Wong, Janice Chan_  
TBD

*Webscraping*  
_Joshua Dull*, Thomas Guignard, Belinda Weaver_  
The Maintainers hope to return to the lesson over the summer months and add new Maintainers.  

*Introduction to Python*  
_Konrad Foerstner, Drew Heles, Elizabeth Wickes, Laura Wrubel* (Past Maintainers: Carlos Martinez, Richard Vankoningsveld)_  
The Python lesson maintainers have been reviewing several repositories with Python-related lesson content, cleaning up outstanding issues and PRs, and working on revised learning objectives and a lesson design document. They are taking a fresh look at the interfaces used in the lessons (e.g. Spyder and Jupyter) and planning to use their design document to guide lesson improvements.  

*Introduction to Data for Archivists*  
_Jenny Bunn*, Noah Geraci, and James Baker_  
This lesson is still looking for new Maintainers as the current Maintainers have moved on.  

*Wikidata*  
_Muhammad Elhossary Till Sauerwein Konrad Förstner_  
The group held a [brainstorming session](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WikiCite_2018/Program/Tamalpais_3B_-_WikiCite_in_education) at WikiCite 2018 in Berkeley which laid the foundation for the lesson and set the scope of the content. There have been 3 sprints with the latest one in April. Members of the community are invited to join the sprints which are announced on the Wikidata mailing list. The draft lesson can be found at [https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-wikidata/](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-wikidata/).

On the near horizon, each lesson Maintainer group will be looking into whether their lesson is ready to publish (for example, see this[OpenRefine issue](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/lc-open-refine/issues/40)). The community will also be working on improving Library Carpentry material in an upcoming [Mozilla-Library Carpentry Global Sprint](https://librarycarpentry.org/blog/2019/03/lc-mozilla-global-sprint/) this May.

The best way to track the work of the Maintainers is by looking at the issues and pull requests in each lesson repository under the [Library Carpentry GitHub organization](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry). If you are interested in becoming a Maintainer, please contact [Chris Erdmann](mailto:Christopher.Erdmann@ucop.edu).

As always, thank you to the hard work of our Maintainers!
