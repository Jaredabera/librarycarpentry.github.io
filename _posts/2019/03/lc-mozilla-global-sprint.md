## Library Carpentry Sprint, 30-31 May, 2019

The Library Carpentry Sprint is part of the [2019 Mozilla Global Sprint](https://medium.com/read-write-participate/mozillas-global-sprint-is-becoming-even-more-open-dac2de762429), which will take place worldwide throughout the month of May. You can find us on [Mozilla Pulse]().

We've participated in a number of sprints over the years. Have a look at a couple of our past sprints:

* [November 2018](https://librarycarpentry.org/blog/2019/02/top-10-fair-published/) 
* [May 2018](https://librarycarpentry.org/blog/2018/05/our-latest-sprint/) 

Sprints allow us to improve upon and develop new Library Carpentry material while meeting and collaborating with people in the community. If you are new to Library Carpentry, [our website](https://librarycarpentry.org/) has some information to help get you started. 

Anyone is welcome to join us during the Sprint!

To register, use the Etherpad to list yourself and/or the group you will be working with:

[https://pad.carpentries.org/2019-lc-mozsprint](https://pad.carpentries.org/2019-lc-mozsprint)

How will the sprint work?
We will use [our chatroom](https://gitter.im/LibraryCarpentry/Lobby) and the [Library Carpentry GitHub repository](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry) to organise work during the 2-day sprint. You can also link to a collaborative document (i.e. another Etherpad or Google doc) that you/your group will be using during the sprint. Join the chatroom at any time using your GitHub username or your Twitter handle.

You can participate in the Sprint in many ways:

* Help improve our lessons

* Contribute to a new lesson

* Consider improving the Library Carpentry website

* Review/test a Top 10 FAIR Data and Software Thing or add a new one

When you decide on what you and/or your group would like to work on, please list it in the Etherpad (next to where you registered):

[https://pad.carpentries.org/2019-lc-mozsprint](https://pad.carpentries.org/2019-lc-mozsprint)

People can start working today. There will be people available to answer questions at most times before and during the sprint. We will use the chatroom to wrangle those questions and offer any clarifications. We will also have a dedicated Zoom channel with calls happening at the top of the hour for most of the sprint. The Zoom channel will be:

[https://UCOP.zoom.us/j/575467341](https://UCOP.zoom.us/j/575467341)

You will be able to ask questions via the video calls as well (which we will also use for networking). If you are not sure about something, please post a question in the chatroom (directed to someone in particular, if need be) and someone will get back to you.

## How the sprint will be organised
There are a number of dedicated sprint sites ([see them here](https://pad.carpentries.org/2019-lc-mozsprint)), all of which will start working at different times around the world. Sites/groups will organise their own work and report back on how things are going during video calls, via the chatroom, or through the hourly handovers (where the baton will be passed on to the next locations).

Sprinters can work on whatever they like. If you are trying to decide, have a look at the different ways listed above that you can get involved, and again, you can come up with your own ideas if you would like. If you are new to sprints and/or Mozilla-Library Carpentry sprints, feel free to reach out to the community via the channels listed above and the community can hopefully answer any questions you may have. You can also reach out to [chris@carpentries.org](mailto:chris@carpentries.org) if you have further questions about the sprint.

## Social media for the sprint
If you tweet, please tweet about the event using the handle [@LibCarpentry](https://twitter.com/LibCarpentry) and the hashtags #lc2019 and #mozsprint. Photos are good too. It would be great to have photos of each site’s sprinters so we can do an illustrated blog post of how the sprint went. Please do share your photos in the various channels that we will be using during the sprint.

## What you can do
Work on existing lessons/Things by:

* submitting pull requests to suggest changes (please keep each pull request small - one or two changes only per PR - to make them easier to manage for maintainers)
* raising issues for discussion/amendment against specific lessons using the Issues tab on each lesson
* chatting with others in the chatroom or via the daily catchups and video calls
* working through lessons/Things with colleagues as a way of familiarising yourself with the material
* discussing all things Library Carpentry including what you have done or what you are planning to do at your site
* identifying any confusing gaps or assumptions in lessons/Things so we can make the lessons more learner-friendly.
* make suggestions to improve the Library Carpentry website
* and anything else you can think of?

## Check with the Maintainers
You can find a list of the Maintainers involved in developing and maintaining the lessons on "[Our Lessons](https://librarycarpentry.org/lessons/)" page and also on the individual "[Top 10 Things](https://librarycarpentry.org/Top-10-FAIR/)" pages. If you will be working on a lesson/Thing before/during the sprint, be sure to check in with the Maintainers.

## If you want to choose a different time?
If the sprint dates/times, 30-31 May 2019, do not work for you and/or your group, no problem. Feel free to arrange separate sprint dates/times. This year the Mozilla Global Sprint is flexible and you can sprint all throughout the month of May. If you do choose separate dates/times, please note when you will be meeting in the Etherpad next to your name/group name information and the project. This way, others will know what you are working on and can get in touch.

## See you at the sprint!
